    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

        //methods for copying an array 

      players2 = [...players]
      players3 = Array.from(players)
      players4 = [].concat(players)
      players5 = players.slice()


      console.log(players3, players3, players4, players5)

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    const shopsIn = {
      napa: { 
        cofee: ['starbucks', 'dolce', 'dutch bros'],
        clothes: ['adiddas', 'nike', 'lulu']
      },
      sanFran: {
        food: ['hotpot','ramen','sourdough'],
        candy: ['sees','Ghirardelli']
      }

    }

        //copying an object 

    const notWes = Object.assign( {}, person, {age:100} ) //creates a shallow copy, any changes to properties deeper than level 1 will change the reference object

    console.log(person)
    console.log(notWes)

        //poormans deep
    
    const noCash = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(shopsIn))  //deep levels no longer reference original object => deep changes wont modify shopsIn
    console.log(noCash)


    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
